if so, which variables were of significance?**

**Explanatory Variables:** Any combination of the variables listed above.

**Response Variable:** Class (3 Levels: High, Medium, Low)


## Reflection: 

This dataset was interesting and very intuitive. We were able to conduct several different analyses and methods
to come to a conclusion which satisfied our research question. Our team worked well together and believe that 
we produced a meaningful product. We enjoyed our time in Stat199 and got a great introduction to data science. 
Thank you so much again to the TAs and Professor Santo for the time you have put in for us.
